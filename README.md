ATSDR ToxGuide for the iOS Platform Prototype
===========
The ATSDR ToxGuidesTM are quick reference guides providing information such as chemical and physical properties, sources of exposure, routes of exposure, minimal risk levels, children's health, and health effects. The ToxGuides also discuss how the substance might interact in the environment. The ToxGuides were developed by the ATSDR Division of Toxicology and Environmental Medicine. Information is excerpted from the corresponding toxicological profiles.

Prototype write-up is available through [PHIResearchLab.org](http://www.phiresearchlab.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5:-atsdr-toxguide-for-the-ios-platform-&catid=1:prototypes&Itemid=3)
